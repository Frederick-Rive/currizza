        <p class="biotext">Cooking has always been my passion and that is what brought me to Wellington in the year 2009 to study Hospitality Management. I had a deep urge to do something different when it comes to cooking. I partnered with a well known Indian restaurant in 2014 and took it to a new height during my association period of four years. I introduced fusion curries and amazing cocktails to the menu which was highly appreciated by the customers.</p>

        <p class="biotext">One day an idea raced through my mind and Currizza, the Pizza Shop, was born. After a lot of research, experiments our team came up with amazing Curry Pizza variations. Currizza was established with the belief that 'Pizza' and 'Happiness' must go hand in hand making your experience special. We understand our customers and we know how to keep them happy.</p>
